# hemanth's dotfiles

dotfiles for my linux mint system. includes:

- alacritty
  - my current terminal. haven't done a lot of research on what's out there tbh
- betterlockscreen
  - a better i3lock screen (i3lock is the default lock screen included with i3)
- dunst
  - a notification service. installed to customize notifications with color pallette
- i3 (INCOMPLETE - references some scripts for monitor setup not included here)
  - a tiling window manager, replaces the default XFCE included with my download of linux mint
  - tiling window managers are GAME CHANGERS for laptops. touchpads suck, and navigating windows with kb is a much better experience
  - i'm on i3 because i've had some issues with wayland before. if i wanna switch, i can use the same/similar config in sway
- nvim
  - neovim config. i use vscode for coding tho
- picom
  - a compositor that i use with i3. not really sure what it does, but this config adds borders to windows
- polybar
  - a status bar that replaces i3's default bar. spent too much time on this lol
- rofi
  - a menu launcher. i use it to launch applications and also as a shutdown menu
